## Overview

My favorite code editor is [ VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) mainly because it is highly customizable and some of the awesome features you encounter here are created and maintained by developers just like you!

VS Code has a market place which makes it easy for you to add features to your editor that can help you to be more productive when developing applications.

**Here are my some tips, shortcuts, and set-up that you can feel free to incorporate in your environment**

## üé® Theme:

I created my own dark color theme called Golden-Blue color Theme. It an enhanced version of the `Tomorrow Night Blue`.

1. You have to install the font in your VS Code first
2. Click on the settings icon, located in the left bottom. ‚öôÔ∏è
3. Settings
4. OR use the shortcut CTR+,
5. Under Commonly Used>>Text Editor Select Font
6. You can just add the name of the font and default fonts

**Important: You must have the font installed and have the exact font name and defaults, Read the docs**
