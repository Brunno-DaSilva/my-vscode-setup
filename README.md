## Overview

My favorite code editor is [ VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) mainly because it is highly customizable and some of the awesome features you encounter here are created and maintained by developers just like you!

VS Code has a market place which makes it easy for you to add features to your editor that can help you to be more productive when developing applications.

**Here are my some tips, shortcuts, and set-up that you can feel free to incorporate in your environment**

## üé® Theme:

My color theme is an edited version of the VS Code default dark theme `Tomorrow Night Blue`
